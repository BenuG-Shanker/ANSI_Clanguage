Programming related C++ language

**Built in Snippet Code** for the common and regular code used in C++ Programming Language is as follows through VSCode editor :

-> click on the Gear icon (representing settings)
-> then click the preferrable programming language json i.e., for C++ select (cpp.json)
-> after clicking on to  the selection, comment out the code which is written below (Example) line to the second last clossing curly braces(}).
-> rewrite statement which is showing ("Print to console") as whatever name you want to give to your snippet, and write same sentence by replacing the statement next to description one ("Log outout to console"), same statement to be written out there.
-> then, in body within square brackets([]), write the common code line by line within the double quotes by erasing the written code as-

PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN CODE WITHIN SQUARE BRACKETS UNDER BODY:
		"console.log('$1');'",
		"$2",

NEW CODE TO BE WRITTEN BY REPLACING OTHER WITHIN SQUARE BRACKETS UNDER BODY:
		"#include<iostream>\n",
		"using namespcae std;\n",
		"int main()",
		"{",
		"\t$1",
		"\treturn 0;",
		"}",
-> after, doing some changes
open new page and write the name which you had used earlier in (description).
-> then, youcan see the common snippet code for cpp program will arive while typing some letters.
-> please refer the changes in below photo
